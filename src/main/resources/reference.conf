akka-kryo-serialization {
  # Possibles values for type are: graph or nograph
  # graph supports serialization of object graphs with shared nodes
  # and cyclic references, bqut this comes at the expense of a small overhead
  # nograph does not support object grpahs with shared nodes, but is usually faster
  type = "graph"

  # Possible values for id-strategy are:
  # default, explicit, incremental, automatic
  #
  # default - slowest and produces bigger serialized representation. Contains fully-
  # qualified class names (FQCNs) for each class
  #
  # explicit - fast and produces compact serialized representation. Requires that all
  # classes that will be serialized are pre-registered using the "mappings" and "classes"
  # sections. To guarantee that both sender and receiver use the same numeric ids for the same
  # classes it is advised to provide exactly the same entries in the "mappings" section
  #
  # incremental - fast and produces compact serialized representation. Support optional
  # pre-registering of classes using the "mappings" and "classes" sections. If class is
  # not pre-registered, it will be registered dynamically by picking a next available id
  # To guarantee that both sender and receiver use the same numeric ids for the same
  # classes it is advised to pre-register them using at least the "classes" section
  #
  # automatic - Contains fully-qualified class names (FQCNs) for each class that is not
  # pre-registered in the "mappings" and "classes" section
  id-strategy = "default"

  # Define a default size for byte buffers used during serialization
  buffer-size = 4096

  # The serialization byte buffers are doubled as needed until they exceed
  # maxBufferSize and an exception is thrown. Can be -1 for no maximum.

  # can be extended and registered here.

  # If set, akka uses manifests to put a class name
  # of the top-level object into each message

  # If set it will use the UnsafeInput and UnsafeOutput
  # Kyro IO instances. Please note that there is no guarantee
  # for backward/forward compatibility of unsafe serialization.
  # It is also not compatible with the safe-serialized values
  use-unsafe = false

  # The transformations that have be done while serialization
  # Supported transformations: compression and encryption
  # accepted values(comma separated if multiple): off | lz4 | deflate | aes
  # Transformations occur in the order they are specified on serialization
  # and reverse order on deserialization. For example: "lz4,aes"
  # lz4 usually offers a good middle ground between size and performance.
  post-serialization-transformations = "off"

  # Settings for aes encryption, if included in transformations AES
  # algo mode, key and custom key class can be specified AES algo mode.
  # The configured key provider class `io.altoo.akka.serialization.kryo.DefaultKeyProvider`
  # returns the key configured under `encryption.aes.key`.
  # To dynamically provide an aes key extend the `io.altoo.akka.serialization.kryo.DefaultKeyProvider`
  # and configure it here.
  #
  # Example configuration:
  # encryption {
  #   aes {
  #     key-provider = "io.altoo.akka.serialization.kryo.DefaultKeyProvider"
  #     mode = "AES/GCM/PKCS5Padding"
  #     iv-length = 12
  #     # password/salt properties are only required when using the default key provider
  #     password = j68KkRjq21ykRGAQ

  # which are serialized

  # If enabled, Kryo logs a lot of information about serialization process.
  # Useful for debugging and lowl-level tweaking
  kryo-trace = false

  # If enabled, Kryo uses internally a map detecting shared nodes.
  # This is a preferred mode for big object graphs with a lot of nodes.
  # For small object graphs (e.g. below 10 nodes) set it to false for
  # better performance.

  # For more advanced customizations the [[io.altoo.akka.serialization.kryo.DefaultKryoInitializer]]

  # If enabled, allows Kryo to resolve subclasses of registered Types.
  #
  # This is primarily useful when id-strategy is set to "explicit". In this
  # case, all classes to be serialized must be explicitly registered. The
  # problem is that a large number of common Scala and Akka types (such as
  # Map and ActorRef) are actually traits that mask a large number of
  # specialized classes that deal with various situations and optimizations.
  # It isn't straightforward to register all of these, so you can instead
  # register a single supertype, with a serializer that can handle *all* of
  # the subclasses, and the subclasses get serialized with that.
  #
  # Use this with care: you should only rely on this when you are confident
  # that the superclass serializer covers all of the special cases properly.
  resolve-subclasses = false

  # Define mappings from a fully qualified class name to a numeric id.
  # Using ids instead of FQCN leads to smaller sizes of serialized representations
  # and faster serialization.
  #
  # This section is mandatory for idstartegy=explicit
  # This section is optional  for idstartegy=incremental
  # This section is ignored   for idstartegy=default
  #
  # The smallest possible id should start at 20 (or even higher), because
  # ids below it are used by Kryo internally e.g. for built-in Java and
  # Scala types.
  #
  # Some helpful mappings are provided through `supplied-basic-mappings`
  # and can be added/extended by:
  #
  # mappings = ${akka-kryo-serialization.optional-basic-mappings} {
  #   fully.qualified.classname1 = id1
  #   fully.qualified.classname2 = id2
  # }

  # classes to be used for serialization.
  # The ids for those classes will be assigned automatically,
  # but respecting the order of declaration in this section
