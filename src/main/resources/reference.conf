			# Possibles values for type are: graph or nograph  
			# graph supports serialization of object graphs with shared nodes  
			# and cyclic references, but this comes at the expense of a small overhead  
			# nograph does not support object grpahs with shared nodes, but is usually faster   
			type = "graph"  
			
			  
			# Possible values for idstrategy are:  
			# default, explicit, incremental  
			#  
			# default - slowest and produces bigger serialized representation. Contains fully-  
			# qualified class names (FQCNs) for each class  
			#  
			# explicit - fast and produces compact serialized representation. Requires that all  
			# classes that will be serialized are pre-registered using the "mappings" and "classes"
			# sections. To guarantee that both sender and receiver use the same numeric ids for the same  
			# classes it is advised to provide exactly the same entries in the "mappings" section   
			#  
			# incremental - fast and produces compact serialized representation. Support optional  
			# pre-registering of classes using the "mappings" and "classes" sections. If class is  
			# not pre-registered, it will be registered dynamically by picking a next available id  
			# To guarantee that both sender and receiver use the same numeric ids for the same   
			# classes it is advised to pre-register them using at least the "classes" section

			# If enabled, Kryo logs a lot of information about serialization process.

			# If enabled, Kryo uses internally a map detecting shared nodes.
			# This is a preferred mode for big object graphs with a lot of nodes.
			# For small object graphs (e.g. below 10 nodes) set it to false for 
			# better performance.

			# Define mappings from a fully qualified class name to a numeric id.

			# This section is optional  for idstartegy=incremental  
			# This section is ignored   for idstartegy=default

			# The smallest possible id should start at 20 (or even higher), because
			# ids below it are used by Kryo internally e.g. for built-in Java and 
			# Scala types

				# fully.qualified.classname2 = id2

			# The ids for those classes will be assigned automatically,
